rOS is a cloud-based ERP solution distributed via subscription, focused on improving ERP systems through opened communication layers and the ERP OPEN API, enabling seamless integration while preserving system uniqueness. The solution features a hierarchical N-tier budgeting system standardised by items and materials with AI-driven budget allocation, plan-fact accounting, and financial tracking. It includes an automated inventory accounting system directly integrated with budgeting and fixed asset management, as well as precedent management powered by AI to improve corporate processes and provide consultations for resolving business cases. The built-in ERP designer allows users to customize ERP systems by operating with abstractions such as accounts, general ledgers, and workflows, enabling businesses to create tailored ERP solutions based on existing core functionality. The system supports extensibility by integrating custom software libraries into the running rOS Cloud ERP. Documentation on the ERP OPEN API and ERP constructor is stored in a structured Wiki format.
